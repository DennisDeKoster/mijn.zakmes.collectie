# 🗡️🔦 My EDC Collection

This repository contains a simple, personal HTML page to display and manage my **Everyday Carry (EDC)** collection.  
Currently it mainly includes **pocket knives** and **flashlights**, but other gear (multitools, pens, watches, etc.) may be added in the future.

This project is strictly for my own personal use and reference — not intended as a public app or showcase.

## Features

- 🗡️ Detailed display of pocket knives (steel type, blade length, hardness, lock type, etc.)  
- 🔦 Detailed display of flashlights (max lumens, throw, runtime, battery, IP rating, special modes like strobe/SOS/beacon, etc.)  
- 🖼️ Card layout with product images and brand logos  
- 🔍 Live search (text + brand filtering via logo click)  
- 📊 Filter by category (All / Pocket Knives / Flashlights)  
- 🔄 Sorting by multiple fields (purchase date, purchase value, new value, brand, name, weight, length, steel type, lumens, reach, etc.)  
- 💰 Automatic summary: total count, total new value, total purchase value per category  
- 📱 Mobile-friendly (with scroll-based card highlighting on small screens)  
- ✨ Nice hover effects and shine animations on cards
